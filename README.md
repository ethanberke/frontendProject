This Frontend repo  is a random image generator.  There are four buttons that invoke an AJAX request to load an image of a Shiba Inu, Cat, Bird, or Fox to the DOM.  The fifth button will completely clear the container, leaving it the same way the document appears when a user first opens the page.  Clicking the same button multiple times will change the image every time, but the facts below will always stay the same.  

Each button, with exception to the clear button, will play an MP3 of the animal that the user is accessing.

Within each animal's fact sheet are embedded links that will take the user to websites that provide more information about that animal.


My motivation to do this web page was my love for these animals.  I love Shiba Inus and how they resemble foxes.  The cats and birds were easy to incorporate since they came from the same API as the Shiba Inu.  Once I had the AJAX requests working as I intended, I had the idea to add bird calls since they are one of nature's most beautiful forms of music.

The following APIs were used:

https://shibe.online/api/cats?count=1&urls=true&httpsUrls=true'
https://shibe.online/api/birds?count=1&urls=true&httpsUrls=true'
